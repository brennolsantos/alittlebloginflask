##LinuxBlog

LinuxBlog is an experimental blog written in Flask and Vue.js, where anyone can share and comment
posts about Linux and its Distros

It is in the initial fases of delevopment, and the base of auth and blog blueprints (where
the views are), models and configurate are almost done. I will implement tests and, as I said in the begginning of the README, a front-end application with Vue.

So, here we are and you are free to follow my journey. Let's go!
